# Monster-Slayer

*** Beginner friendly game made with Vue.js. ***

You got 4 options. Attack, Special Attack, Heal and Surrender.
Every attack deal random damage between (5 and 12) for player and (8 and 15) for monster attack.
Special attack deals little bit more than that.
Heal option does the opposite, this option adds you random amount of health.
And last option is Surrender which makes the monster win this game.

At the bottom, you got a battle log with every single move you and the monster did.
